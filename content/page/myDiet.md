# My Diet
empowering users to monitor their information diets

Our *information diet* is increasingly determined by personalisation algorithms. We believe citizens have a right to know whether the information we are being fed truly nourishes our development and agency, at an individual and societal level.

Facebook’s personalisation algorithms have an impact on our lifestyles, priorities, moods, opinions and ultimately the decisions we make. Yet we are prohibited from understanding their mechanics and objectives. 

With fbTREX, we can better monitor our information diets, and get insights into how they present to us different realities. Who is informing us, and about what topics? Are we being provided with misleading information or deceptive advertising?

Promoting algorithmic diversity and our right to pick our own algorithms is a primary goal for fbTREX. We are creating a community to share, compare, improve, remix, and critique algorithms as autonomous and informed individuals deciding what kind of information is most appropriate for ourselves at any given time, and exploring potentially healthier alternatives for social interaction.

### Privacy

At tracking.exposed we **REALLY** care about privacy. That's why fbTREX prioritises the protection of personal data. Access to the full fbTREX dataset is strictly limited to researchers analysing collective phenomena in the public interest. We are asking individuals only to share some of the public data that Facebook provides them. The goal of this collection is to study social media, not the subjects participating to the initiative. Still, this information can contain a lot of personally identifying information (PII), so fbTREX’s ethical policy imposes the following limits:
* We will collect only the information that Facebook provides to you in your news feed, not in groups or you own profile page.
* We will collect only posts marked as public. We will never collect posts marked for friends only.
* You have full control over your data, and may delete it at any time.
* No one will have access to your data unless you expressly grant them access. You will have to opt-in to any third-party, including research groups, that you may want to interact with.
* All research conducted must strictly aim at understanding social phenomena and algorithmic influence, you will never be the subject or object of any study.
