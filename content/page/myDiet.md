# empowering users to monitor their information diets

Facebook’s personalisation algorithms have an impact on our lifestyles, priorities, moods, opinions and ultimately the decisions we make. Yet we are prohibited from understanding their mechanics and objectives. 

With fbTREX, we can better monitor our information diets, and get insights into how they present to us different realities. Who is informing us, and about what topics? Are we being provided with misleading information or deceptive advertising?

By becoming an adopter of fbtrex, you are participanting in a user-driven initiative to make social media more transparent.


## How to become a power user and know your habits

##### 1. Install the fbTREX browser extension

It's easy to install for both [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-tracking-exposed/) and [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/facebooktrackingexposed/fnknflppefckhjhecbfigfhlcbmcnmmi).<br>

##### 2. Download your data

You will get a csv that contains the posts you have seen, by which sources, their content, as well as other metadata. You can either download a csv by clicking on "Your Data" above any post in facebook or use our python library, which you can install from our github repository. Another option is to directly get your data from the API: you can read the docs here.

##### 3. Visualize and get insights

After you have downloaded and/or transformed your data, you can visualize it using a spreadsheet software like Excel or LibreOffice Calc. You can also use Tableau, Rawgraphs.io or any other data visualization app. You can also start browsing your data in a visual way directly with our interface by clicking on "Your Data".

## Privacy

At tracking.exposed we **REALLY** care about privacy. That's why fbTREX prioritises the protection of personal data. Access to the full fbTREX dataset is strictly limited to researchers analysing collective phenomena in the public interest. We are asking individuals only to share some of the public data that Facebook provides them. The goal of this collection is to study social media, not the subjects participating to the initiative. Still, this information can contain a lot of personally identifying information (PII), so fbTREX’s ethical policy imposes the following limits:
* We will collect only the information that Facebook provides to you in your news feed, not in groups or you own profile page.
* We will collect only posts marked as public. We will never collect posts marked for friends only.
* You have full control over your data, and may delete it at any time.
* No one will have access to your data unless you expressly grant them access. You will have to opt-in to any third-party, including research groups, that you may want to interact with.
* All research conducted must strictly aim at understanding social phenomena and algorithmic influence, you will never be the subject or object of any study.
