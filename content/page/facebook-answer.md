Facebook promised some kind of "transparency" to the European Commission; we argue their answer is entirely unsatisfying.
We identify three reasons why this concept of transparency is misleading:
1. In the "Why am I seeing this post?" tool there are no traces of the experiments Facebook regularly runs on us. 
2. In the "Why am I seeing this post?" tool there are no traces of the vast amount of excluded post. 
3. The "Why am I seeing this post?" is only another engagement strategy: educate the user to click more on the reactions that content triggers to them.
