FaceBook claim to had solve transparency problem introducing a simple tool close to the post: the Why am I seeing this post? function. This answer is misleading in three ways.
1 In the Why am I seeing this post? tool there are no traces of the experiments Facebook regularly runs on us. 
2 In the Why am I seeing this post? tool there are no traces of the huge amount of excluded post. 
3 The Why am I seeing this post? tool is only another engagement tool. Remember the big deal is your data!
