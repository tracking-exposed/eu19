Facebook promised some kind of "transparency" to the European Commission; we argue their answer is entirely unsatisfying.
The company presented the "Why am I seeing this post?" as an act of transparency, but we consider it misleading because:
1. There are no traces of the experiments Facebook regularly runs on us. 
2. There are no traces of the vast amount of excluded post. 
3. Is only another engagement strategy: educate the user to click more on the reactions that content triggers to them.
