# Every facebook user can benefit from fbTREX
### Want to know more about how Facebook shapes your perception?

Facebook’s personalisation algorithms have an impact on our lifestyles, priorities, moods, opinions and the decisions we make. Yet we are prohibited from understanding their mechanics and objectives. 

By installing the fbTREX browser extension, you can get insights into how they present different realities to us. We, as researchers, commit to analyze social phenomena and not individual behaviour. We all need to understand how algorithms interact with us. Because of their personalized nature, and the opacity of Facebook, only with a collective distributed observation we can get a grasp. 

Join us if you want to know who is informing you, which topics Facebook prefers, what is kept away from you despite your subscriptions to a page or a friend. By becoming an adopter of fbtrex, you are not just getting the insights Facebook does not offer you on your own activity, but you are also participanting in a user-driven initiative to make social media more accountable and transparent.

### How to become a power user and be in control of your information diet

##### 1. Install the fbTREX browser extension

        <p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-tracking-exposed/" target="_blank" class="btn"><b>Download for FireFox</b></a></p>

##### 2. Download your data

You will get a csv that contains the posts you have seen, by which sources, their content, as well as other metadata. You can either download a csv by clicking on "Your Data" above any post in Facebook or use our python library, which you can install from our [github repository](https://github.com/tracking-exposed/dashboard). Another option is to directly get your data from the API: you can [read the docs here](https://github.com/tracking-exposed/eu19/blob/master/texts-wip/api.md).
If you decide to join the EU19 initiative, researchers will only be able to see the posts from the News Media pages that will be compared.

##### 3. Make visualizations and get insights

After you have downloaded and/or transformed your data, you can visualize it using a spreadsheet software like Excel or LibreOffice Calc. You can also use Tableau, Rawgraphs.io or any other data visualization app. You can also start browsing your data in a visual way directly with our interface by clicking on "Your Data".

##### 4. (Optionally) Compare with other friends

1. First, download your csv(s) and share them using email or any other way you can think of.
2. Open both csv(s), select all the content of the second (excluding the first row), copy it, and paste it under your first one. You can repeat this process multiple times to concatenate more csvs.
3. Use the resulting csv in Google Sheets or in Rawgraphs.io; The examples below are an example on how two friends can compare each other, but you can play with more visualizations.
